## How to Use Pneumatics for Clamps

1. Connect the pneumatic system: Ensure that the pipe is correctly connected to the pneumatic controller before turning on the pump. This connection ensures the flow of pressurized gas to the system.

![classes](./controller.jpeg)

2. Pneumatic controller components:
   - The gold piece: Press this to check if there is pressurized gas inside the pump. It acts as a pressure indicator.
   - The center piece: Pull down the center piece and rotate it clockwise to increase the output pressure. It is recommended to set it to 0.2MPa (as indicated by the black label). Once set, push it back up to secure the desired pressure. To reset it to 0, pull down the center piece and rotate it counterclockwise before pushing it back up.

Opened: Can rotate

![classes](./open.jpg)

Closed: Cannot rotate 

![classes](./closed.jpeg)

   - The right side opening: This opening is meant for the output valve and should be connected to the pneumatic controller. Ensure a secure connection for proper operation.

3. Inserting the pipe into the pneumatic controller: To properly insert the pipe into the pneumatic controller, push in the white ring while inserting the tube. This ensures a tight and secure connection.

![classes](./connect.jpeg)

4. Connecting the clamp:
   - Identify the correct side of the clamp: Look for labels such as "S" and "O" on the clamp. Ensure the appropriate side is connected based on your specific clamp model and requirements.
   
   ![classes](./clamp.jpeg)

   - As seen in the picture, there are 2 clamps connected parallely. This is simila0r to electronics where the current gets split in parallel connections however the voltage in this case the air remains the same.

   - Connect the output of the pneumatic controller: Connect the normal open (NO) or normal close (NC) output of the pneumatic controller to the corresponding input of the clamp. This connection allows the controlled flow of pressurized gas to the clamp.
   - At the pneumatic controller, there is a overide switch which can be pushed to change the airflow from normal open to normal close

   ![classes](./solid.jpg) 
   ![classes](./symbol.png)

   When the valve is at rest position, the air flows from B->S and P->A while R is closed noted by the T symbol.
   When the valve is on, the air flows from A -> R and P -> B while S is closed as denoted by the T symbol.
 
   So wire the solenoid valve accordingly based on whether you want you clamp to be normal open or normal closed by chosing the air flow from P to A where A is the O on the clamp which stands for open. For normal closed it would be instead S.

5. Operating the pump: Click on the pump to start it. This will initiate the pumping process, delivering pressurized gas to the pneumatic system and activating the clamp.
