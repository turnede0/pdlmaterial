# Introduction to FPGA

  
## Digital Circuit
Electronic Circuit in general can be divided into 2 main catogories: analogue circuit and digital circuit.
### Analogue circuit
An analog circuit processes and manipulates **continuous** electronic signals, uses components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transistors.

Example: Power modules, Amplifier, Radio Frequency Circuit

### Digital circuit
A digital circuit processes **discrete** signals represented by binary digits (0s and 1s)
It uses components such as logic gates, flip-flops, and registers, which is alos mainly contrusted by multiple transistors.

Example: Microprocessor, Digital Signal Processor, Graphical Processing Unit

In this course, we will focus mainly on digital circuit.

## Development of Integrated Circuit

The advancement of Integrated Circuit and Chip can be easily illustrated by the Scale of Integration. Meaning, to fit more and more transistor into a defined surface area. 

SSI Small-Scale Integration
MSI Medium Scale Integration
LSI Large-Scale Integration
VLSI Very Large-Scale Integration
ULSI Ultra Large Scale Integration
